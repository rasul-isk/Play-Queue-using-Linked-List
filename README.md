# Play-Queue-using-Linked-List

This repository demonstrates how to simulate a Play Queue similar Spotify’s version by the use of linked list data structure. 

# Main Task

Design an app to simulate a Play Queue similar Spotify’s version. Use a linked list to store the track (song/artist) details on the Play Queue. The app should be capable of adding a track to the queue, list recently played track(s), and change the order of tracks on queue.
